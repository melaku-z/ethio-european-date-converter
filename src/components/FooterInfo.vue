        The Ethiopian calendar (Amharic: የኢትዮጵያ ዘመን አቆጣጠር) or Eritrean calendar
        is the principal calendar used in Ethiopia.
      </p>
      <p>
        The calendar has twelve months of thirty days plus five or six
        epagomenal days, which comprise a thirteenth month. A sixth epagomenal
        day is added every four years, without exception. There is a gap of
        seven to eight years between the Ethiopian and Gregorian calendars.
      </p>
      <p>
        New Year's Day occurs on September 11th in the Gregorian Calendar;
        except for the year preceding a leap year, when it occurs on September
        12th. (This date correspondence applies for the Gregorian years 1900 to
        2099.)
